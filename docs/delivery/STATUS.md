## Open and deferred work

**0001 — Session durability in a horizontally-scalable cluster**

- `0001-T11` 💤 deferred: Client-facing reconnect during promotion + spec-legal QoS-1 redelivery bounds (takeover hardening) — takeover-serve is proven through the store (F-d); client-facing MQTT reconnect mid-promotion and redelivery bounds deferred to a later hardening pass

**0004 — Identity model: mTLS Common Name first, deny by default**

- `0004-T9` 💤 deferred: Full OIDC discovery / JWKS rotation; MQTT5 enhanced auth after v5 codec — step 6 takes a single static key; enhanced auth waits on the v5 codec milestone
- `0004-T10` 💤 deferred: Delivery-time ACL re-check in the hub (enforcement is subscription-time only) — documented known limitation; needed only if policies change under live subscriptions; tracked with hot ACL reload
- `0004-T11` 💤 deferred: SAN-based identity, per-listener auth policies, hot ACL reload, %c (client-id) substitution — %c deferred until the Authorizer trait carries the client id; the rest are future config options

**0005 — Session affinity: relocate persistent sessions to their owner**

- `0005-P2c` 💤 deferred: Delivery/lifecycle hardening of the splice (best-effort on half-close) — splice is best-effort on half-close; a delivery/lifecycle hardening pass is a documented follow-up
- `0005-P3` 💤 deferred: MQTT 5 Server-Reference redirect replacing the relay for v5 clients — "Re-assessed 2026-07-02: the original blocker (no v5 codec) is gone (ADR 0008), so this is now buildable — but parked on the OTHER half of the original condition: mainstream v5 clients (paho, mosquitto) do not auto-follow Server Reference / 0x9C redirects, so the relay must remain the universal path regardless and a redirect would only serve clients that opt into handling it. Revisit if a redirect-capable client population materialises; the proxy serves 3.1.1 and v5 alike meanwhile."

**0007 — Wiring the durable cluster session store into the broker**

- `0007-T8` 💤 deferred: Dynamic-reconfiguration hardening under rapid churn (flap -> ephemeral degrade) — v1 debounces stable join/leave; rapid flapping / lost-quorum degrades to ADR 0005 ephemeral per the accepted limitation; no flap-stress proof exists yet

**0010 — Shared subscriptions**

- `0010-T7` 💤 deferred: Subscription-Identifier handling for shared subscriptions — ADR 0010 Consequences notes no Subscription-Identifier handling yet; out of scope for the routing lever

**0013 — MQTT 5.0 enhanced authentication (AUTH exchange)**

- `0013-T8` 💤 deferred: Server-initiated re-auth (server sends AUTH 0x19 to demand re-authentication) — ADR section 4 explicitly defers this — needs a trigger mechanism and interacts with the select-loop outbound path; only client-initiated re-auth is implemented (no server-side AUTH 0x19 send exists in conn.rs).

**0017 — Durable attach waits for an authoritative session, never downgrades**

- `0017-T9` 💤 deferred: Make recovery deadline/backoff configurable (currently constants) — ATTACH_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT/BACKOFF are constants for now; ADR defers promoting them to config until an operator need appears

**0018 — On-disk persistence for durable state**

- `0018-T7` 💤 deferred: Process-kill (SIGKILL mid-write) crash-consistency test — rests on redb's own ACID/crash suite; an in-repo subprocess kill test adds machinery for modest marginal coverage

**0019 — Graceful shutdown and connection draining**

- `0019-T8` 💤 deferred: Lease-leadership transfer when the leaving node is the Raft leader — "Spike 2026-06-25 (openraft 0.9 transfer-API evaluation, the task's stated prerequisite): openraft 0.9.24 exposes NO public leadership-transfer/TimeoutNow API — Trigger has only elect/heartbeat/snapshot/purge_log. change_membership-remove-self steps the leader down internally (raft_core.rs:1311 -> leader_step_down) but does not provoke an immediate election, so the remaining voters still wait out their election timeout: it does not close the gap. Trigger::transfer_leader exists only on the alpha-only 0.10 line (latest 0.10.0-alpha.23, Jun 2026; no beta/RC/stable, no v0.9->v0.10 upgrade guide; maintainer keeps 0.9.24 as the production default). Deferred pending a stable openraft release exposing transfer_leader — pulling an alpha into the consensus core is a poor trade for a bounded ~1.5-3s graceful-leave gap (relaxed ADR 0026 timing) that already degrades safely via survivors' election."
- `0019-T9` 💤 deferred: In-flight QoS settle / hub Drain command — drain closes after current packet; durable state already protected by ADR 0018 + raft shutdown

**0032 — Hot-reloadable security policy**

- `0032-T9` 💤 deferred: Follow-ons via the same mechanism — cert revocation (reloadable CRL → WebPkiClientVerifier) and peer-bus TLS reload — "Partly delivered. Cert revocation via a reloadable CRL → WebPkiClientVerifier is **done** (ADR 0002 T8: server_config_with_crl + MQTTD_TLS_CRL, applied through this ADR's reloadable acceptor; tests/tls.rs reloading_a_crl_revokes_a_client_in_place). Still deferred: peer-bus (cluster) TLS reload — the same pattern applied to the peer acceptor/connector, kept off the consensus bus for now to avoid coupling a client-facing change to membership/quorum."

**0033 — Filesystem-watch auto-reload of the security policy**

- `0033-T7` 💤 deferred: Follow-on — optional notify-backed (inotify/FSEvents/kqueue) event-driven backend behind the same seam, if sub-second reaction is ever needed — polling covers the config-rollout use case with no new dependency; an event-driven backend is a latency optimisation that still needs the same retry-until-parse/debounce, so it is parked behind the watcher seam rather than bundled.

**0034 — Foreign-client interop conformance testing**

- `0034-T7` 💤 deferred: Follow-on — a second foreign client (Paho Python) behind the same harness for richer assertions (reason codes, properties, flow control) — start with one independent oracle (Mosquitto) to bound CI surface and flake sources; a second client adds coverage on the same harness once the first is stable in CI.

**0036 — MQTT-over-QUIC transport (multi-stream)**

- `0036-T11` 💤 deferred: Follow-on — 1-RTT resumption tuning (ticket lifetime / resumption policy under mTLS-on-every-connection) — 1-RTT session resumption is quinn/rustls-provided and replay-safe (0-RTT stays disabled, T1); explicit ticket-lifetime/policy tuning is a follow-on, separate from migration. Distinct from migration — resumption is a NEW connection reusing crypto, not a live connection surviving a path change.

**0038 — Pre-release compatibility freeze (versioned wire, stamped schemas, final codecs)**

- `0038-T2` ⬜ planned: Schema-version stamps — shared redb schema gate (stamp fresh, pass equal, fail closed on mismatch) adopted by sessions/replicas/lease/retained stores
- `0038-T3` ⬜ planned: Retained MQTT 5 fidelity — app properties through the durable record codec, RetainedCommit/Update/Snapshot frames, and the persistent retained store
- `0038-T4` ⬜ planned: Wire-shape finalization — named serde structs for multi-field entries; frozen-vs-versioned frame inventory recorded
